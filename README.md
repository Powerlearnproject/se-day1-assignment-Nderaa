Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It helps in the creation of software applicarions and systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of proframming languages like Fortran and C.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's.
The rise of Agile Methodologies in the 2000's.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements. Check the User needs and system requirements
Design. Create high level designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implement. Write the code and build software according to the design specifications.
Test. Conduct various tesrs to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deploy. Release the software to users.
Maintain. Provide ongoing support, uopdates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential methodolody while Agile is more iterative and incremental. Waterfall is therefore more rigid while the latter is more flexible.
Case in point, in a project where waterfall is used, each step of the project ought to be documented making it detail oriented while at the same time more lenghty.
Agile methodology is more flexible as it emphasizes less on documentation saving on time.
While they have their differences, they are both goal oriented.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software Developer writes code
A quality Assurance Engineer checks the software quality.
A program manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are important as they provide comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code. An example of an IDE is Visual Studio.
Version Control Systemsare software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among members. An example of VSC is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines. Ensuring prioritization of tasks and making of a feasible schedule.
Changing requirements. Ensuring effective communication and re evaluation of project goals.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing refers to individual component testing. It helps in early bug detection reducing cost that would have occured later on.
Integration testing looks at the interaction between software components. It helps in detecting interface issues.
System testing is where the entire software system is tested as a whole. It ensures that the software meets the functional and non-functional requirements.
Acceptance testing is the testing of software against user requirements. This ensures customer satisfaction.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting your questions and answer in a way that can assure you the best possible answers from an AI model. It helps in bridging human and artificial intelligence.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about dogs.
Tell me about the history of domesticated dogs.
The first prompt is vague as it would mean that the AI would give a general answer and the second prompt would ensure a more specific answer.
